1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,879
okay guys in this video I'm gonna talk
to you about modules so sometimes you're

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,849
gonna have functions that you're gonna
want to use over and over and over again

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,219
maybe not only in the same program but
maybe in different programs so instead
of having to rewrite the function every

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,760
single time what you can do is you can
throw all the functions that you're

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,260
gonna use over and over again in a
separate file and then just include that

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,510
file in whatever program you're working
on so not only does it help you from

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,930
writing a bunch of code but it also
helps organize your programming a little

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,190
bit better and I'm gonna show you guys
how to make those right now so again

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,230
like I said right now we're gonna make a
macho that's just a function included in

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,469
another file so we're gonna need another
file so right click on your project and

11
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,070
a write new Python file so I'll just
name this home I don't know like tuna

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:03,809
so tuna dot P Y dot py is the extension
for a Python file and then hit OK so now

13
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,250
our project has two files in the same
directory this main which is our main

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,119
program the one we've been working on
and this tuna is the one we just made

15
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,530
and we can just delete that that doesn't
really matter

16
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,119
so in this tuna file I'm just gonna make
a really simple function right now so

17
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,210
death now I'll just call it you can call
it anything you want I'm just name it

18
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,280
fish because I don't know much of his
name to us so why the heck not all right

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,840
so this function is just kind of like
prints on my land screen easy colons

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,880
alright I'll just say I am a tuna fish
there we go
alright so say that we wanted to use

21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,180
this function over and over and over
again so we just wrote it once we threw

22
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,530
in a module and we're good to go
so now whenever we actually want to use

23
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,670
it go back to your main program and what
you can do is in order to use any of the

24
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,219
stuff in your module you first need to
say ok we want to include another file
so how do we do that well we actually

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,190
type the word import and that means go
get a file from somewhere else in

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,360
use it in this program so then it says
okay well what's the name of your file

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,700
well it's just called tuna and you don't
write py because whenever you import a
module it knows that of course it's

28
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,470
another Python Python file so again no
need to include that py don't do it it

29
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:38,210
knows so right now in this program we're
working on we included basically this

30
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,260
basically what's going on behind the
scenes is it goes to this file copies it
and paste it right in here even though

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,050
you know you don't see it that's kind of
a good example so if you just run this

32
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,650
right now check it out nothing happens
why is that well we included this but we

33
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,430
didn't say to actually use this function
right in here so in order to use

34
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,440
functions that are inside modules we
just can't write fish like this even

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,520
though this function is named fish right
here check it out if we run it it says

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,880
okay fish is not defined so why can't we
do that well the reason for that is say
we were including a bunch of modules

37
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,600
maybe root um there's some modules that
we wrote maybe some that our friends

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,980
wrote maybe some that some random people
on the internet row well maybe each of

39
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,570
those modules each have a function name
fish so whenever we just call it like

40
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,910
this it's not going to know which
function or what function from the

41
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,440
module to use so before we call the
function we need to specify the name of

42
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,040
the module that were using it from so
tuna da fish what this means is go to

43
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,519
tuna the tuna module and from there call
the function named fish so now whenever

44
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,269
you run it check it out it goes to tuna
finds fish and calls this or runs it

45
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,940
whatever you want to call it so that is
how we can build our own module and use

46
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,320
the crap inside it but there are also
ways to use other people's modules and

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,230
I'll show you how to do that right now
so one module that you're going to be

48
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,830
using a lot is called a random and this
is just a simple one to generate a

49
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:25,250
random number another random stuff so if
you write import random actually it just

50
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,080
pops up right there
and answer what you did is it basically

51
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,670
includes a bunch of functions that they
aren't built into the core Python

52
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,660
language but we can just import them
really easily and we can also download

53
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,860
other modules from the internet and use
those as well but this is the one or

54
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,660
excuse me this is one that's included
with PyCharm so whenever we import it we

55
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,730
can use those functions and I'll show
you guys a real simple one real quick so

56
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,990
we'll just make a random number from
like 100,000 of course the modules name

57
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,320
is random and a function that is inside
it is called R and range and this just

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,860
takes a range of numbers like 1 like I
said to a thousand so now what we did is

59
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,550
we generated or n number one two
thousand stored it in the variable X and

60
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:22,250
if I just print that out and hopefully
this time it was 236 and who the heck is

61
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:28,250
texting me right now all right anyways I
gotta go deal with that and actually in

62
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,760
the next video what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna show you guys a real cool way in

63
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,630
easy way where you can go grab modules
from the internet and download them and

64
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,650
the cool thing about it is we don't have
to open up our browser or anything all

65
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,220
the tools are built right into PyCharm
so that's what you have to look forward

66
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,000
to I'll see you then
