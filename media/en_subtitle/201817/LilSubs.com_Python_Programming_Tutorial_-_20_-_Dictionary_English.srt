00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,470
alright guys welcome back and in this
video I'm going to talk to you about a

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,750
dictionary in Python now whenever you
have a dictionary in real life you have

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,969
a bunch of words and they're associated
with a bunch of definitions now in
Python we have names for these instead

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,359
of words and definitions we call them
keys and values and the cool thing about

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,619
Python is you're not only limited to you
know like a definition like you would

6
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,369
think in a dictionary you can also use
numbers and stuff like that so let me

7
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,070
show you an example right now so the
first thing you have to do is of course

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,620
just name it whatever you want and then
set it equal to and then use those curly

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,020
braces now inside your curly braces
you're going to have sets of a key and a

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,590
value and you can have as many as you
want you can have one you can have 100

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,850
it doesn't matter so for the key I'll
just write Tony and for the value

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:04,470
actually let me use single quotes so
write the key and think of this like the

13
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,540
word in the dictionary and then add a
colon and then after that colon is the

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,170
value and I'll write cool smells so say
that this dictionary is um storing like

15
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,650
everyone in my class so again the key
which is Tony and the value of this is

16
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,650
cool but smells so whenever you want to
add a new item what you have to do is

17
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,350
just separate them with commas and then
I'm too lazy to do the format again so
I'm just going to do that alright so

18
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:42,140
this key can be for Emma and her value
can be I don't know I'll say she sits

19
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,780
behind me let's add one more so comma
umm one more person could be like Lucy

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,170
and her value will be I don't like
Lizzie because she asks too many

21
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,340
questions alright so now we have a
dictionary called classmates and it's

22
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:11,220
made up of three key value pairs Toni
Emma and Lucy so I guess I can go ahead

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,320
and just print this out real quick so if
you just print

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,190
the name of your dictionary without
specifying any one of these individually

25
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,690
then there's just going to go ahead and
print the whole thing as expected now

26
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,390
obviously you can do cooler things in
this you can print something like um

27
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:36,950
classmates and then in square brackets
put the key Emma so this is pretty much

28
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:44,090
saying print the value of Emma and of
course Emma's value is sits behind me so

29
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,870
again you can do this with each
individual item in your dictionary or

30
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,330
I'll show you guys something really cool
this is probably the coolest thing that

31
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,310
you can do with it what you can do is
instead of having to go through your

32
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,280
dictionary one at a time like Emma Tony
okay who's the next Lucy o mg that's

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,750
taken forever there's a real quick way
that you can loop through it so what you

34
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,360
do is you use a for loop and then you
know how we just gave our for loop a

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,360
variable name and that was the name of
whatever item

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,550
it was looping through at the time well
since a dictionary is composed of keys

37
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:28,670
in values we actually need to give it
two variables so we'll say K and V and
this is what people typically use and

38
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:36,800
this is pretty much saying whenever we
loop through it treat K is the key so

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,880
the first time is going to be Tony then
Emma the Lucy and V is going to be the
value so this is going to be cool but

40
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,870
smell sits behind me and ask too many
questions and then after this we just

41
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:57,620
need to say in classmates items simple
enough so again this is the dictionary

42
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,560
that's looping through and it's going to
loop through all of the items so now I

43
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,410
can just put something like print arm
kay I don't know let me think of

44
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,870
something stupid okay
I don't even know how I can have this

45
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,790
make sense okay I just do something
really easy k plus V which is pretty

46
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,750
much going to print out this and this
simple enough

47
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:32,500
so actually let me get rid of these so
it doesn't confuse you so as you can see

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,570
since we didn't have spaces let me add
spaces real quick so our bunch together

49
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,389
what it does is you build a dictionary
right here your dictionary o is composed

50
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,340
of keys in values we have three of them
in this case and what this loop did is
it loop through this dictionary and for

51
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,169
each item in your dictionary it printed
the key and the value
so of course the key is just the name

52
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,860
and the value is a little note we wrote
about them so that is what this little

53
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,199
program does and that is how you can
build a dictionary in Python and in the

54
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,750
next couple tutorials they're actually
going to be a lot more interesting than

55
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,500
this because I'm going to start showing
you guys how to work with modules and

56
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,820
also how to build a very simple web
crawler it's probably going to be the

57
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,750
coolest program roommate we made up to
date so think guys for watching and I'll

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,229
see you next time
