00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,710
alright guys welcome back to another
video and if you ever want to make a
program like Instagram or just want to

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,440
make some cool photo filters and this is
probably going to be one of the most
important tutorials because I'm going to

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,630
show you guys how to take pillow and use
it to pretty much break up your image
into separate channels

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,010
so again programs like Instagram and any
like photo editing program uses all the

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,810
time so let me go ahead and explain
exactly what's going on for those of you
who may not understand now whenever

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,579
computers display images they don't
display things like we just look at them

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,480
in real life in real life you can like
hold your hand two inches away from your
face and you're not going to see any

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,980
pixels or anything like that however
whenever your computer displays images

9
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:55,079
let me just zoom in right here you can
see that every single image is actually

10
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,149
made up of these tiny things called
pixels now it's pretty much a bunch of

11
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,900
individual boxes but when you zoom out
it looks like a whole picture simple

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,760
enough you guys probably already know
what a pixel was now the thing I want to

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,000
explain is this each one of those pixels
pixels is actually made up of three

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,049
colors see right now this looks like I
don't know like 100 different colors but

15
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,369
each of these boxes are just a
combination of three colors mixed

16
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,560
together with various amounts red green
and blue now actually in Photoshop if

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,890
you click on channels you can see that
that's all this image is this is the red

18
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,509
this is the green and this is the blue
now you guys are like yeah right that's

19
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,189
just black and white for all of them I'm
not yet well the black whenever we click

20
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,710
on one of these channels it symbolizes
how much red is in this channel how much

21
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,840
green is in this and how much blue now
whenever we combine this much blue with

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,210
this much green in this much red that's
when we get this picture right here so
again that's kind of key to remember

23
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,800
every single image is made up of three
different colors

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,850
and it's pretty much saying this is how
much of each color you add to get your
whole image actually i'ma show you guys

25
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,910
this if you took this image and took out
the red then of course you would only

26
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,520
have green and blue if you took out the
green so I have like this purple because

27
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,960
it's only red and blue so on and so
forth

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,940
all right so I guess that did take a
little more than 60 seconds I lied but

29
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,590
now that we understand that let's go
ahead and learn how to use pillow to

30
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,640
take that image and break it up into
these individual channels because right
now just show you guys how to do it and

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,610
have this plan but later on I'm going to
show you guys how you can take these

32
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,810
channels and tweak them to either edit
the contrast or make some cool

33
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:04,130
old-school effects stuff like that so
the first thing we need is actually let

34
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,710
me show you I probably should explain
this now 99% of the images on your

35
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,060
computer or I'll say like 95 percent of
them are going to be made up of three

36
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,970
channels red green and blue however
sometimes people have images that are

37
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,680
CMYK and those are made up of four
colors because those are better from

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,830
like printing things in real life but in
order to determine first that you

39
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,420
actually are working with image made up
of three colors red green and blue what
you can do is you can just print out the

40
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:44,810
mode of your image you can see whenever
I run this it prints out the mode so

41
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,970
this JPEG right here is RGB it means it
is indeed made up of three and most of

42
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,170
the time it is so you don't really have
to worry about that but I felt like if I

43
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,190
didn't tell you guys then you know
people would complain so so now that we

44
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,780
verified that this image is indeed made
up of three channels let's go ahead and

45
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,030
split them apart so the function is
split them apart is of course call your

46
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,519
image and call the function split now
what this function does is it actually

47
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,299
returns a tupple so it's going to return

48
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,120
three values and we're going to store
those values in the variables r g b so

49
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,180
again it's going to
turn three values the first value we're

50
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,820
going to store in the variable R the
second one G and the third one be simple

51
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:43,310
enough so what these are are actually
these channels so it's going to return

52
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:50,720
this for R this for G and this for B so
if you don't believe me check this out

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,490
if you go down and you just hit our show
and run this I'm just going to show you

54
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:06,500
that red channel and you can actually do
this for green and blue too so now I'm

55
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,250
going to show my green one and now I'm
going to show my blue one and actually I

56
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,690
kind of like doing this like to close
out all of these and run these all at

57
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,930
the same time because it just looks cool
in Photoshop our G B I don't know I

58
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,200
think that's so cool it's actually
probably kind of stupid but I think it's

59
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,440
kind of cool so again now we have pretty
much three separate images created or

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,510
three image objects one is the red
Channel ones the green Channel and ones

61
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,640
the blue Channel
so now we can do cool things like arm

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,220
well actually I'll show you guys
something really cool in the next story

63
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,340
because I'm kind of running out of time
don't want my file to get too big so
well the next tutorial is going to be

64
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,910
awesome
I'll see you then
