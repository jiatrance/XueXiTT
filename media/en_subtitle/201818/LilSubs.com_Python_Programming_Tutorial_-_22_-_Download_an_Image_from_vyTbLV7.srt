00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,170
alright guys this is going to be a cool
tutorial because I'm going to show you

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,490
guys how to build a very simple program
where you can download an image from the

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,070
internet so the first thing I want to do
is import that random again and that's

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,760
because whenever we download an image
we're going to be giving it a random

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,430
filename and saving it as that because
we don't want to UM let so let's say we

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,849
were downloading like all the homepage
images we don't want a bunch of files

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,920
named homepage jpg in our directory so
I'm going to give each one a random name

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,190
and um whenever we build our web crawler
that's what we're going to do as well
and we're also going to be importing URL

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,680
Lib dot request now this is a package
that allows us to get um data from

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,489
websites pretty much that's a really
simple explanation and also I want to

11
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,699
mention this if I'm ever using a module
that you're like oh hold on a second um

12
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,359
you didn't tell me how to get that or
where I'm supposed to get that from or

13
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,589
what it does I'll explain that right now
whenever I have a module in here they

14
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,340
here that you're not familiar with go to
file settings and then if you go to your

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,770
project interpreter these words are hard
to say project interpreter on the Left
what you can do is this is the section

16
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,909
that allows you to download modules from
the internet so these are the ones that

17
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,600
I downloaded right now so say that we
wanted to add another one or install
another one click this little plus

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,770
button and you can search for all of
them right now now usually you know

19
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,409
exactly what one you're going to
download so if you start typing the name

20
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:44,299
of download like here's one I'm familiar
with um beautiful scraper right here

21
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,409
just select its name and hit install
package and then just sit back and relax

22
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,689
that's what's awesome about pycharm this
entire thing is built in the entire
module was just installed

23
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,259
you know whenever you want to use it we
can just import it right like this and

24
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,310
of course if you accidentally download a
one by accident or we're playing around

25
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,830
with it and figure it out you didn't
need it file settings the interpreter

26
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,980
and then just select it and hit this
minus sign
and that'll say that will uninstall it

27
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,810
basically so pretty cool but now back to
the tutorial so again I'm just going to

28
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,030
build a real simple function to go to
some on website download the image so

29
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:36,810
def download web image and the only
parameter that's going to take is just

30
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,959
the URL of the image of course so the
first thing I want to do is I want to

31
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,620
generate that random number just like we
did in the last tutorial so this is

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,310
going to be the name so I'm going to
story is the variable name and of course

33
00:02:50,310 --> 00:03:00,360
you remember random dot R and range and
I'll just say one to a thousand so all

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,989
the images that we download are going to
be like 256 jpg arm like sixteen jpg so

35
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,250
on and so forth and this is um not the
best way but for this example it'll be

36
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,299
simple enough to follow along so now
what I want to do is whenever I download

37
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,690
it of course it's just going to be
stored as a number right here and

38
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,069
obviously what I want to do is add that
JPEG extension on the end so my computer

39
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,950
knows that it is indeed a jpg image so
full name will be the full file name and

40
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,910
of course we take that name which is a
random number one 1000 and what we're

41
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:42,389
going to do is we're going to add on the
dot jpg extension now remember before I

42
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,340
said that Python doesn't really like
when you take a number and add it to a

43
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,569
string so we need to convert this name
variable to a string and in order to do
that just put STR and this is a really

44
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,010
simple function that takes a number and
converts it into a string so now we're

45
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,489
working with the same data type now the
full name would be something like five

46
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,980
hundred jpg so the only other thing we
need to do one more line of code in this
function is download the image and of

47
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,859
course that's where we imported this so
in order to use anything from this

48
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:26,130
module type the name of the module which
is URL Lib dot request and the function

49
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,740
is called URL
retrieve now if you see it's going to

50
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,140
take a couple of parameters here the
first one is the URL of the website that

51
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,470
you're going to be downloading it from
pretty much um it's like going to be

52
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,530
HTTP on Bucky's room org slash Bucky's
face JPEG something like that so we're
going to be passing it in the function

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,260
so that's what the URL is and the second
parameter it takes is whenever we save

54
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,490
this or download it and save it to your
computer what do you want to name the

55
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:06,420
file well that's why we created this
right here so download this image and

56
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,650
save it as this on our computer so
that's all this function is doing right
here so now what we have to do is just

57
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,870
right download web image and we need to
pass it in a URL of some JPEG on the

58
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,380
internet so actually if you just go to
any site then I'm not going to show you

59
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,280
how to do that but it's all the same but
don't go to like a random site and say

60
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,010
hey Bucky told me to do this because
it's probably against their Terms of

61
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,520
Service but if you just want to practice
then you can just go - Bucky's room find

62
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,260
one of my images I'm on my profile right
now click view all photos and let's find

63
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,750
a don't want it down this is pretty dumb
all right so of course in order to get

64
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:55,940
the URL this you can just right click it
and hit copy image URL and of course

65
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,740
this pretty much is the URL of the image
on the internet so now back in our

66
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,229
program what we can do is remember to
pass it in as a string what we're saying

67
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,990
is basically download this image so it's
going to download it give it a random

68
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,280
filename and then save it to our
computer now it's going to download in
the same directory as our programs

69
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,250
around and so check this out this is my
main project YouTube and this was the

70
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,540
module from last tutorial and this is
where the program is going to run so

71
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,140
right now we only have two files main
and tuna but after we get done running
this we're also going to have an extra

72
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:39,479
jpg in here so keep your eyes on this
while I run it so check it out you see

73
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,620
how it just said 286 and
five just popped up well double-click

74
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,400
that and boom
pretty sweet we just downloaded an image

75
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,830
purely through Python programming so
just imagine the power of this we can

76
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,840
download a crapload of images in the
snap of a finger if we only knew how to

77
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,920
write a simple web crawler well ladies
and gentlemen that's what we had to look

78
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,010
forward to in the next tutorial but for
now thank you guys for watching don't
