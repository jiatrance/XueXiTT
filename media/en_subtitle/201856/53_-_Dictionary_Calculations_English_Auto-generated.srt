00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
already houses welcome back and in this
video I'm going to show you how to

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,880
perform calculations on dictionary
values rather than the keys if you guys

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,410
are like wow that sounds incredibly
boring I am probably never going to need

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,550
this check this out
let's say that you just out of this

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,039
awesome formula - I don't know like
predict the prices of stocks so you have

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,699
all these stocks and the first thing
that you gotta figure out is just what

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,160
is I don't know like the cheapest stock
so you try to do something like this
using your programming skills alright

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,079
I'm just going to print min it gives me
the minimum value of some sets some data

9
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,850
set or iterable so I'll just write
stocks right there and it should give me

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,260
the cheapest one wait a minute it said a
APL hmm let's look at this right here
that's not right see Apple is 325 bucks

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,940
and the cheapest one looks like Ford so
why the heck isn't this working

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,799
well it actually did work just not in
the way that you thought see by default

13
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,600
whenever you're running these
calculations on a dictionary it's going
to look at the key rather than the value

14
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,400
so this is the key and this is the value
so it did give you the minimum one it's

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,950
just that the minimum one in
alphabetical order was Apple but that's

16
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,420
not what we want we want the cheapest
one which is Ford so how the heck do we

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,619
get that long stocks no not let's figure
this out all right so we can't just sort

18
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,240
it the default way or else we don't get
what we want what we actually need to do

19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,240
is we actually need to create a new list
and we do that by using zip now whenever

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,259
you use it what this is going to do is
it's going to return a list of tuples so

21
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,159
what we can essentially do is anytime
you have two lists we can essentially

22
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,110
zip them together so what we're going to
do is we're going to get a list of these

23
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,450
values and a list of these values and
we're going to tie them together so the

24
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,200
value is first so essentially what we
end up is with is something like this

25
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,689
instead of goob
four three four we end up with four

26
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:26,390
three four gook and then we end up with
three to five AAPL there we go so again

27
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,709
this isn't valid Python but I just want
to demonstrate what we're essentially

28
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,200
doing let me just go ahead and comment
that so you guys can see all right so

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,720
let me just say mint price holy min rice
the minimum amount of rice that I can

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,299
eat in one day is one pound no less what
am I talking about all right let's go

31
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:53,629
ahead and keep going art so we're
getting the minimum still we're going to
get the minimum value but instead of

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,939
just throwing our dictionary in there
before because that's just going to sort

33
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,620
by the keys what we're going to do is
this we're going to zip two values

34
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,329
together now what values do you want is
it together or the first one is just

35
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:15,379
going to be the values so how do we get
that we just read stocks values easiest
thing ever

36
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,530
now the second one is going to give us
stocks keys so all we're doing right

37
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,359
here is instead of having the keys first
in the value second all we're saying is

38
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:30,349
put the values first in the key second
easiest thing you've probably ever done
in your life and now let me just print

39
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:40,280
out what we found so print out mint
price and there you go all right so what

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,430
we did is we now reorganize that
essentially that's all we did and we

41
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,439
print out the minimum which is indeed
forward so there you go that ladies and
gentlemen is how you perform custom

42
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:57,409
dictionary calculations on the values
rather than the keys you can go make

43
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:01,519
millions with your incredible awesome
stock formula now I'm going to keep

44
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,349
making videos so I'll see you guys next
time
