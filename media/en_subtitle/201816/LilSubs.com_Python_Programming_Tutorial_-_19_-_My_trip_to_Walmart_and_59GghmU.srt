1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,629
alright guys so it is 12:35 a.m. and I
actually just got back from Walmart

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,679
because I needed groceries and pretty
much the only place that's open around

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,809
here like midnight is Walmart so I was
shopping and I was like halfway done
with my shopping actually not even

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,830
halfway done and I saw this guy I was
bited like the cheese's I was getting

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,119
string cheese and this guy was like
staring at me and I was like huh okay

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,480
maybe like knows me from somewhere since
I don't know like high school or

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,329
something and so finally after like
staring I prefer minute he like comes up

8
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,129
to me and he's like are you the new
Boston I was like uh yeah and it's

9
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,090
always weird when like people come up to
me because I guess uh like quite a few

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,530
people watch my tutorials but it never
shows my face so I don't even know how

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,520
people know what I look like but anyways
it was kind of weird because I never I

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,980
don't know I just never know what to say
and also at the time the only thing I
had in my car was ground beef and toilet

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,729
paper so he probably thinks I'm pretty
weird now but anyways on with the

14
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,780
tutorial where we're going to be talking
about sets so what a set is it's I think

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,180
pretty much like a collection of items
but it can't have any duplicates like a

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,100
list can so I'll show you guys with
grocery since well it's on my mind I
spell that right

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,189
hopefully alright so in order to make a
set it's going to look kind of like a

18
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,110
list except you use these curly braces
right here and let me put a couple

19
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:45,659
things in here so cereal for some reason
my pie charm seems like it's all well

20
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:53,430
seems like it's lagging a little bit
alright so cereal milk I got some star

21
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,420
crunches - I'm addicted to those things
however when it's really hot out outside

22
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,130
if you ever eat a star crunch they taste
disgusting which is really weird

23
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,990
alright so so we got some beer or we
have to get beer or whatever this

24
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,979
grocery list is for um duct tape what
else

25
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:20,099
on my list lotion and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to add beer again now
remember that I told you that what we

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,400
did right here is we've made something
called a set that's what this is however

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,190
it can't have any duplicates now if you
notice we have beer right here and also

28
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,980
beer right here
twice so what happens is whenever we

29
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:45,079
print this out print groceries check it
out it prints everything on our list

30
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:53,370
however it only prints beer once pretty
cool so again this is actually helpful

31
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,470
whenever you make something like a
grocery list or any set where it's

32
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,420
pretty much useless to have the same
item twice so I'll show you guys

33
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,870
simply actually we're making a program
where we're printing out a grocery list

34
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,950
for like I don't know maybe we're making
an app where we can sort grocery lists
online and we can look at it on our

35
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,859
smart phone it's actually a pretty good
idea anyways we'll say if milk and

36
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:25,590
there's some actually some cool things
that you can do with sets in I can spell

37
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,579
in groceries so this condition right
here it's going to return true if indeed

38
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:40,099
milk is in groceries which it is right
now so we'll say print um something like
you already have oh no cost so we'll

39
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,160
check pretty much if we're if we already
have the item in there if we do no need
to add it again so else

40
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:05,430
um prints of like oh yeah you need milk
like a little reminder I don't know

41
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,440
first thing they popped into my head so
of course we run this and it says you

42
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,720
already have milk oz so again that that
is pretty much what set is and that's

43
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,539
one small thing that you can do with a
set you can check if an item is indeed

44
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,580
in
it just like you would a list however in

45
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,470
later tutorials when every are built in
like a little more advanced programs

46
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,560
I'll show you guys some other things
that you can do with sets in how they

47
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,610
are incredibly useful but for now um
thank you guys for watching and I'll see

48
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,940
you later
