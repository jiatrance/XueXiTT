00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
all ready guys welcome back and in this
video I'm going to show you a really

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,519
cool way to get the most frequently
occurring item in a list but before we

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,320
do I just want to give a quick shout out
to Caleb Haslam and Nathan Bradley they

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,640
each contributed 5 bucks to my patreon
account I love you guys I want to have

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,820
your babies and yeah let's get on to the
tutorial all right so let's say that we

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,679
have any list but in this tutorial let
me go ahead and copy this alright so
there we go so I just have this chunk of

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,340
text right here and I'll remember huh I
don't even remember where I pasted this

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,059
from somewhere maybe on my website or
something but we have any text you can
have any list and we want to get the

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,960
words that occur most frequently maybe
my PR guy was yelling at me he's like

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,160
dude you save the same words over and
over again and I probably do so how can
we do that well we can write our own

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,500
custom function or I'll show you guys a
cool little module so from collections

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:10,619
we're going to import the class counter
so this is gonna this is actually pretty

13
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,850
cool class if you want to dive deeper
well what it essentially does is you

14
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,040
pass it in a list and then you can run a
bunch of cool statistics on it now we

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,670
already have one issue and that's that
this right here is just a big ol long

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,850
string we actually need to convert all
of these words into a list so in order

17
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,770
to do that it's actually really easy
just say words you can name your

18
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,140
variable anything you want of course for
this text string in order to make it

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,500
individual a list of words all you do is
your right split so that it breaks up a

20
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,770
string into a list so now we have a list
that's I don't know like maybe 50 words

21
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,920
long or whatever and just to show you
guys real quick just print this out

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,600
alright so now we can see that we have a
list look at that looking good so now

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
that we have a list we want to get the
most frequently occurring word so how do

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,730
we do that well let me just make a just
name a counter wine

25
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,489
and I'm going to set this equal to
counter which is an object from the

26
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,739
counter class or an instance is the
proper term so whenever we initialize

27
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,840
this what we do is we pass in a list so
what that's going to do is it's going to

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,810
say this is our object run a bunch of
statistics about this list just

29
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,370
essentially this right here so boom
roasted it did that now once it's

30
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,840
initialized we can just you know print
out whatever we want so let's say that

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,110
we want the top three occurring words
well for counter which was our object

32
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,030
there is a function called most common
now inside here we can just write any

33
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,090
number we want a 3 5 whatever I'm going
to say 3 and that's going to give me the

34
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:11,450
3 most common words in that list so now
I'll just print top 3 and there we go so

35
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,889
this is actually pretty cool it returns
a list of tuples and the tupple has two

36
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:21,150
parts to it the first one is of course
the word itself the item in the list and

37
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,620
the second one is the frequency counter
so this says hey these are your three

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:34,260
most common occurring words the you
wrote 5 times 2 euro 4 and in was in

39
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,350
your list 3 times so a lot of awesome
information so there you go again a real

40
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,299
quick tutorial but definitely useful and
again there's a lot more to this counter

41
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,010
class but now that I you know got your
guys a feet a little bit wet you can
dive in a little more if you want thank

42
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,120
you guys for watching I'll see you guys
next time
