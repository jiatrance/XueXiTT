00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,079
alright guys welcome back and in this
video I'm going to show you guys how to

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:12,150
convert image modes from a photo so
right now all of these photos baby Bucky

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,660
all of these are RGB and actually 99% of
the pictures you see on your computer on

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,760
your smart phone on your tablet those
are all RGB because that's what

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,320
computers and electronics they work with
easiest they display it really easy and

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,940
crystal-clear however there are going to
be times when you want to convert your

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,239
image to something else for example your
printer chances are that it doesn't use

8
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,059
RGB whenever you print out on like a
picture it usually prints in 4-color

9
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,579
CMYK cyan magenta yellow and K is black
I don't know why they just don't use B

10
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,899
but they're going to be times where you
want to take an RGB image and convert it

11
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,760
to something else so again um if you
ever print something out then it's a

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,830
smart idea to convert it to CMYK first
but just for this example I'll show you

13
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,939
guys how to convert it to black and
white now there are a couple different

14
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,100
ways that you can make a black-and-white
image you can just take your RGB image

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,320
and remove all the basic saturation from
it and end up with a black and white

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,240
image but that isn't how true black and
white image that's just a an RGB that

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,220
looks like a black and white one so if
you actually want a true black and white

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,909
um photo then what you can do is you can
take your original photo actually this

19
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,890
is called baby and you call something
called convert now convert basically

20
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,000
says okay what format do you want to
change this to so by default this is RGB

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,219
so if we call this nothing what happened
because it's already RGB we can also do

22
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:04,079
CMYK for printing but just for this
example on type L now L stands for

23
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,979
luminance it basically means black and
white they should have named it

24
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,500
something a little bit more clear but
apparently they decided that L was

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,590
best symbol for black and white so now
if we take this new object which is

26
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,570
pretty much this image of a baby now
converted to a black and white file type

27
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:32,610
check this out whenever you show this
run main black and white now if you guys

28
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,440
are like alright so how do I know that
this isn't just the RGB image still and
I don't know they just like remove some

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,570
color from it so right now keep the file
open and if you go to channels you see

30
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,890
that we don't have those RGB red green
blue channels anymore we just have this

31
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:58,230
one channel just for black and white so
that way we can verify that indeed it

32
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,600
does work and well I'm not lying all
right hold on just my microphone a

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,660
little bit so that was kind of boring so
now since you guys had to suffer through

34
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:17,250
that I'll show you guys something really
cool now pillow or pill hota

35
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,269
oh these gusting all right so right now
we've been using bunch of functions from

36
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,799
the image class but it also has another
um class that it's actually a lot cooler

37
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,080
in my opinion and that's image filter
now this class comes with a bunch of

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,480
cool built-in on filters that you might
use like blur if you ever want to blur
your image if you ever want to uh do

39
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,739
something like find the edges of it
that's a nice little cool effect oh my

40
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,780
that uh that was embarrassing but uh
probably not even going to edit that out

41
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,320
all right so first let me show you guys
how to blur your image so do we want to

42
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:07,610
use this actually let me use Bucky
actually alright let's use sister

43
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,560
because look at this look how adorable I
look in this one I am one hot piece of

44
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,590
meat
alright so sister

45
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,520
sister and just make any object I'm
going to name my blurry because I'm

46
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,220
pretty much just going to blur the image
so if we take sister that original image

47
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,030
and we add a function called filter to
it what this does is that allows us to
pretty much pass in one of these

48
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,950
parameters and the parameter I want to
pass in is blur so pretty much from the

49
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:53,430
image filter class we're going to call a
function called filter and it's going to

50
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,880
blur this image so let me just show you
guys real quick so blur dot show is

51
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,310
pretty much the same image as before but
now it is blurred pretty cool pretty

52
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:12,030
cool so as you can see um you're like
okay when the heck would I want to blur
image because this is just stupid it

53
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,450
like um is the same image but less
quality actually if you ever um I'll

54
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,710
show you guys an example and this is
actually a really useful tip if you ever

55
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,450
have an image like a flower or something
and you know on those high-end cameras

56
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,419
when you get that depth of field it
looks like the background is kind of

57
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,460
blurry if you ever want to add a photo
filter like that then what you can do is

58
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:45,300
you can actually um pretty much overlay
this blurry image on top of the regular

59
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,340
crystal-clear image and blur it as it
fades out and it'll look like kind of
give you the fake effect of depth of

60
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,440
field if you don't know what that the
field is then just ignore everything I

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,030
just said because I'm not important I'll
show you guys the effect later on

62
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:09,750
alright so another one that you guys
might find pretty cool is detail and she

63
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,979
let me write both of these first and
what this does is it pretty much just

64
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,479
gets the detail of her image it's kind
of hard to explain but uh you'll see it

65
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:27,060
later on sure
let's uh name this one edges and the

66
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,910
property is find edges
there you go so now we already sub blur

67
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:43,340
so now let's go ahead and print detail
see what that one does and also edges
should let me clear this out alright so

68
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,860
run all those make sure I didn't do
anything wrong

69
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,880
all right so this is blur
we already saw this this is detail you

70
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,860
know without comparing them side by side
they kind of look weird but if you look

71
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,950
at the other one
then um it's pretty much like the

72
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,550
opposite of blur it gets the detail and
you guys can see if you compare them

73
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,640
side by side and this one obviously what
it does is it finds the edges it's best

74
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,440
guess and it highlights them so again
you probably just want to want to use

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,850
this stand alone but combined with some
other filters and effects they cannot

76
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:30,570
produce some pretty cool image effects
so that ladies and gentlemen is image
filter for some really basic built in

77
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,560
filters and again the power of this
actually comes when you combine it with

78
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,430
other stuff we're going to be taking a
look at that later on but for now thank

79
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,770
you guys for watching w subscribe and
I'll see you guys later
