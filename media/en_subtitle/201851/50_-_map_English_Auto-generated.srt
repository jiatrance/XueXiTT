00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
all right houses welcome back and in
this video I'm going to talk to you

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,269
about the map function in Python so the
map function is basically a way that you

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,120
can take a list whatever it is you know
a list of foods of names of numbers and
you can run each item in that list

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,289
through a function really easily so
let's go ahead and make a simple list

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,590
I'll just say income so this list is how
much money I make and I'll say the first
week of work I made $10 the second week

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,350
I made 30 bucks and the last week I made
75 bucks

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:44,129
all right so now I have a list of stuff
but I also have this function and I'm
just going to make this function really

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,870
simple to demonstrate you know because
we aren't really learning about
functions or anything complex I just

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,840
want to demonstrate the map function so
all this function is going to do is it's

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,250
going to take each of these items in
multiplying by two so double your money

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,019
so we're going to pass in dollars which
is each item in the list and we're just

12
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:15,590
going to return okay there we go
returned dollars multiplied by two

13
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,270
all right so what we can do is we can
make a for loop so for items in income
and then we can do this yadda yadda

14
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,320
tomato tomahto but there's actually an
easier and more efficient way so what we

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,500
can do is actually call the map function
now the map function takes two

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,850
parameters the first one is what
function are you going to run all of

17
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,549
your items through well it's just double
money now we don't have any parameters

18
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,140
and the second function is alright what
is the list that you want to iterate

19
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,299
through well we only have one list which
is this so do that

20
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,259
so what this is going to do is it's
going to go through this list and for

21
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,799
each item 10 30 75 it's going to run it
through this function now if we just run

22
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,640
this right now it's not going to show
anything because we don't have any
output so let me just go ahead and

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:21,100
very like new income equals list.map all
right looking good

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,230
so I basically am going to run through
this multiply each of these values by

25
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,140
two so we end up with 20 60 and 150 and
then I'm just going to take all those

26
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,470
values and convert it to a list so we
can print it out so print new income and

27
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:46,570
there you go so now you see 20 60 and
150 now again you can also do this with

28
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:52,810
a for loop so just say for item in
income and then you can do it that way

29
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,410
but this is a much easier way in my
opinion and it's a lot more compact so

30
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,610
it doesn't clutter up all your code so
there you go that is what map is

31
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,650
basically taking some kind of iterable
and are running it through a function

32
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,050
boom roasted see you next time
