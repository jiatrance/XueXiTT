1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
all right guys now they understand the
basics of inheritance now I want to talk

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,559
to you guys about multiple inheritance
so this is basically a way where we can
inherit or get stuff from more than one

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,109
class so we can actually inherit from
like three different classes if we want

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,439
so right now I'm just going to be
showing you guys two but the concept is

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,939
the same no matter how many you use so
let's go ahead and make some simple

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,500
classes that we can inherit from and
might as well since it's always fun to

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,309
pretend we're making on a little
computer game so I'll make like um Mario

8
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,450
like if you ever played Mario on
Nintendo so what's one function that

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,680
Mario can do will say that he can move
around so move himself around and we'll
just make this printout something like I

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,879
am I don't know moving whatever who
cares alright so he can move around

11
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,979
something simple
anything you know this is just an

12
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:12,420
example so another class I want to make
is one called shroom so we already know

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,009
that whenever Mario eats a mushroom or
maybe he jumps on it what does he do you

14
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,549
can't jump on him because why would that
do anything he can't eat him because

15
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,979
they're huge almost the size of him huh
I really thought about that well in this
tutorial we're going to say that he eats

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,229
the shroom and probably should name it
mushroom because these rooms make them I

17
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,810
don't know like sound like a druggie or
something but whenever he eats shrooms

18
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:50,189
goes now I am big and this just because
formatting and all right so we have two
different classes right here each of

19
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,810
them have a function in them we have a
Mario class and he can move around all

20
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,030
Mario's can move around and we also have
a shroom class that whenever heats a

21
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,920
mushroom he grows into big Mario so now
what I want to do is I want to make a

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,300
class that can inherit from both of
these things so we're going to make a

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,650
special class called
big mario and we're going to create an

24
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,050
object from this class whenever mario
eats a mushroom now it would be kind of

25
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,510
stupid to rewrite these functions over
and over again for big mario since we
already wrote them one time so instead

26
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,620
of having to write or rewrite a bunch of
stuff over and over what I'm going to do

27
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,900
is I'm just going to inherit these real
quick so I'm going to inherit from Mario

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:48,420
and also shroom so what this does is
whenever we create an object from big
Mario it already has all the

29
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,700
functionality of regular Mario and also
shroom saves us from rewriting a whole
bunch of crap now check this out here's

30
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,980
another thing that I should probably
teach you right now this big Mario class

31
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,210
has two functions in it even though we
can't see them they're there because we

32
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,800
inherited them however any time you make
a class in Python you see that little

33
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,600
red line right there it says ok you
pretty much need to have something in
this class so I don't know that's just

34
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,880
some so you don't get a syntax error so
whenever you need to write something but

35
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,960
it's just kind of like a blank line that
you don't want to add any functionality

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,210
to it you can just write the word pass
what pass means essentially like I said

37
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,290
is if you need a line but you don't want
it to actually do anything like print
out anything or change your code at all

38
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,450
just write pass and it'll fix some it'll
pretty much handle the syntax error so
you don't get any exceptions but also

39
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,660
allow you to I don't know it's like just
look at it you guys can see it's how do

40
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,830
how do I explain how something does
nothing kind of a riddle but I just

41
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,910
tried it and I probably just failed at
it so now let's create an object from
this big Mario class so BM equals big

42
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,890
Mario and of course now what we can do
is we can call all his normal functions

43
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,900
so we can call move look at that it pops
right up so even though we didn't

44
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:28,100
explicitly write any functions in here
since we inherited from this Mario class

45
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,350
we inherited the function move and we
can also call what else did we inherit

46
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:43,860
eat shroom check this out
pretty frickin cool so another reason

47
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,150
that you might use this is let's say you
wanted on I think whenever Mario like
jumps on a flower he can shoot fire out

48
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,550
of his stomach this I never really like
thought about this stuff until I'm like

49
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,730
trying to explain it hopefully you guys
just played the game before also I'm

50
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,440
going to sound like a idiot
so whenever he jumps up whenever he

51
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,150
jumps on a mushroom he grows in whenever
he jumps on a flower he can shoot fire

52
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,910
out of its stomach so if you wanted to
like make a fire class then you could do

53
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,930
that as well and also inherit from Mario
so of course instead of having the right

54
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,400
move move move the function three
different times just inherit from it and
boom so that's another practical example

55
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,020
of when you would use inheritance but
for now I am probably going to not play
Mario because they would drive myself

56
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,940
crazy I'm going to do anything else
thank as for watching don't forget
