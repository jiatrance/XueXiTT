00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,799
alright guys in this video of course you
can see by the title I want to start

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,340
talking to you guys about inheritance a
very important concept in computer

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,960
programming especially with
object-oriented programming so you're

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,920
going to be coming across that a lot so
before I even get started talking about

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,880
computer programming let's just talk
about inheritance in real life what does
it mean well I mean you can inherit like

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,510
um like specific genes from your parents
so I inherited on my dad's eyes I

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,790
inherited my mom's nose and what that
pretty much means is she passed those

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,260
traits on to me whenever they you know
made me as a baby

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,239
and also there's another type of
inheritance like when um I don't know

10
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,160
like if your grandpa dies and you
inherited his land it pretty much means

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,620
that he gave his land to you
so inheritance basically means getting

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,809
something from someone else that's the
most simple definition so what the heck

13
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,700
could have mean in computer programming
let's go ahead and make two classes

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,100
we're going to make one class that's a
parent and we're going to make another
class that's a child and I'll show you

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,860
guys how the child can inherit or get
stuff from the parent so of course they

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,310
don't have any land they don't have I
color so let's go ahead and make some

17
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,259
functions that they can inherit so what
would on the parent do say print last

18
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:37,530
name so of course this just looks like a
normal class right now in my parents

19
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,610
last name is the same of mine of course
so Roberts so right now this parent

20
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,180
doesn't have any cool land doesn't have
a million dollars leave me all it has

21
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,040
this is lonely old function so I'm going
to make another class right here and I'm

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,590
going to name it child and just like
before we can start building functions

23
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,790
but check this out
if you're wondering why do you have

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,740
these empty parentheses right here well
in side these parentheses what you can
pretty much type is the name of a class

25
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,230
that you want to inherit from
so whenever I typed parent inside here
what I'm telling Python is okay look for

26
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,130
a parent class get everything inside
that class then right now it's pretty

27
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,410
boring just one function and pretty much
pass it on to your child so right now

28
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,540
even though it looks like this child
class is empty it actually has in other

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,340
words it actually just inherited this
print last name function so let's go

30
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,920
ahead and make one normal function in
the child class
I'll go umm print first name and this

31
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,770
will just be um it'll just be a normal
function that belongs to the child and

32
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:03,300
it will just print out my first name
which is buggy so check this out right

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,970
now it looks like there's one function
and parent and one function and child

34
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,800
but that's not actually how Python sees
it well Python sees is this one function

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,440
parent and since this child inherited
everything from the parent it actually

36
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,480
has print last name and print first-name
don't believe me I wouldn't either

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,600
because I lie about stuff a lot but in
this case I am telling the true so I'll

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,350
make a function or excuse me an object
called Buckey and it's going to be long

39
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:42,480
to that child class now check this out
if I put Buckey come on you're stupid

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,470
freaking carpal tunnel glove I can do
print first name and we already know

41
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,090
that because the function is right in
that class but did you know I can also

42
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,790
do print last name and check this out
I'm going to run it and it's going to

43
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,950
print Bucky which is just a normal
function and also Roberts which is a

44
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,739
function that it inherited from the
parent so that's the basics the very

45
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,459
basics of inheritance pretty much saying
okay what class do you want to get stuff

46
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,710
from so pretty much doesn't literally do
this but goes that class copies

47
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,140
everything and paste it right in child
simple enough guys understand it good

48
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,880
because now I'm going to talk to you
guys about something that's a little bit

49
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,410
more advanced a little bit more
confusing so right now we have print

50
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,580
lastname basically as a child function
that it inherited now what we can also
do is we can also have the option of

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,120
overriding overriding wow that's a for
some reason hard for me to say the child

52
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,310
can override that function so what we
can do is this def print last name and

53
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:11,410
also I'll just like I don't know make
this print something called schnitzel

54
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,510
burg so I got to tell you guys a story
real quick because I don't have a
therapist and I've been meaning telling

55
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,920
this for a long time to get it off my
chest

56
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,740
but basically whenever my parents had me
they put Roberts on the birth

57
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,120
certificate and that was my last name
for a while growing up Roberts

58
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,570
Bucky Roberts in high school however arm
I found out that my mom was actually a

59
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,790
monkey and I was embarrassed about it so
I ran away from home I joined the circus

60
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,700
and I changed my last name to schnitzel
burg so even though I inherited the name
Roberts later on in life I decided to

61
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,940
over ride it to schnitzel burg so this
is also an option in Python so check

62
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,110
this out
even though I inherited this function to

63
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,820
begin with I have the option of
overriding it and basically in order to

64
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,030
do that you create a same function with
the same exact name and what this says

65
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,890
is okay we're practically going to
replace this with whatever you decided

66
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:23,260
to do here so that is a little story
about my life and that is also how you

67
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:31,690
can inherit something but you have the
choice overriding it or if you don't you

68
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,270
can just use the normal function as well
so now you guys understand in the next

69
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,760
tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys
about multi

70
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,020
full inheritance so we get even more
complex but it's actually going to be a

71
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,560
pretty cool maybe I'll think of another
fake story to tell you guys but for now

72
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,680
then guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you guys later
