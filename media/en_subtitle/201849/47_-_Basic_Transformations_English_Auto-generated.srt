00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
alright guys welcome back to another
video and in this tutorial I want to

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,220
show you guys how to do some basic
transformations on your image and by

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,780
transformation I mean things like resize
flip rotate um like stretch so let's go
ahead and get started and I think I'm

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,390
going to use this picture me as a baby
for this tutorial so I'll name it baby

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:34,350
baby bulky image open baby JPEG and
let's just go ahead and show this first

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,910
so baby show alright so let's see what
we're starting with so this is the basic
image that we're going to be

7
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,899
manipulating and the first
transformation I want to show you guys

8
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,350
is just how to resize it so let me
actually see so the image size of this

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,230
is 450 by 341 let's say we were making
like a website or something or just a
piece of software and we want it to take

10
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,000
an image and make it square so fit
perfectly in our profile now what we can

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,630
do is actually cut out a square from
somewhere in the middle in order to show

12
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,590
you guys how to cut it but if you just
want to pretty much take the image and

13
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,860
resize it into a square this is what you
do just name this square baby and I'll

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,920
set this equal to baby which is your
original file your original photo and

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,329
the function is called
resize and what it does is it takes a
tupple so make sure you add these double

16
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,600
parentheses right here this these
outside ones are for the function

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,159
parameters in these inside ones is
pretty much the tupple itself and the

18
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,290
tupple is of course just the size that
you want to resize it to so i want to

19
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:55,560
take that original image and resize 250
by 250 so now the square baby if we show

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,040
it check it out so that was our original
one and this is our resize the baby

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,819
Bucky square baby so that is how you
accomplish that now another thing I want
to show you guys is what if you want to

22
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,020
flip it upside down or flip it you
horizontally or vertically well let's

23
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,989
name this one flip baby and in order to
do this of course take your original

24
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:30,630
baby object in the function is actually
called transpose and this is actually

25
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,000
the you use the same function whether
you want to flip it or rotate it so what

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,310
you can do is you can um call this
property of actually I wonder if it pops

27
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,930
up yep so flip left right and flip top
bottom are two different ways that you

28
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,030
can flip it of course left to right
along the axis in top bottom this is

29
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,269
pretty much vertical and horizontal
probably would be easier if it said that

30
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,250
actually I think I like left to right
top bottom better so pretty much take

31
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:10,260
the left and put it where the right is
pretty simple so now if we show flip

32
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:20,220
baby we can see I have three different
transformations that was our original

33
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,370
one that was a square one and this is
the flip baby now remember I flipped it

34
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,870
left and right so that's why it didn't
flip upside down that would be top

35
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,000
bottom left to right means pretty much
just flip it along that axis we just

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,049
close all these is getting kind of messy
in the last one I want to show you guys

37
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:46,920
is this might as well type it out so you
can do spin baby and what this does is
if you call baby transpose you can call

38
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:00,870
image dot rotate now as you can see as
soon as I type R we have a couple of

39
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,750
properties that pop up rotate 180 270
and 90 so let me just go ahead and

40
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,019
rotate it 90 degrees actually if we
rotated this image 180 degrees think

41
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,709
about what it does it pretty much just
takes in flips it upside down so it

42
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,989
cheeves the same effect is flip top
bottom but if we just rotate it in 90

43
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,930
degrees then show you guys what it does
right here

44
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:32,889
it'll look like it's on its side pretty
much so let's run all those again check

45
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:40,210
it out original one square flipped and
rotated pretty sweet so those are just
some real quick simple transformations

46
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:50,440
and I suppose square run Oh interesting
but anyways there you go again to square

47
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,780
it up it's resize and for your other
transformations you use the transpose

48
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:01,389
class or excuse me the function so well
there you go in the next tutorial I'm

49
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,010
going to be showing you guys how to
convert one image mode to another image

50
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,900
bone it's going to be sweet so I'll see
you then
