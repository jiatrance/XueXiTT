1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,689
our eighth hostage so we got all the
boring crap out of the way in the last

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,309
video so let's start learning something
cool the first thing I want to show you
guys is basically how to create a new

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,279
image from cutting out an area of your
original image so this of course is my

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,630
original image next let me show you in
Photoshop so say that we want to take

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,949
this and I don't know maybe we need to
crop it because we're using it as a

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,179
profile picture on a website or
something or maybe we just only wanted
part of this because my ex-girlfriend

7
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,350
was on the side so we wanted to crop her
out so what we can do using pillow is

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,050
essentially this we can crop out for
example a piece of this image right here
and pretty much cut it and save this

9
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,840
portion as a new image so let's go ahead
and learn how to do that and let me

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,690
close out of this alright so I deleted
the other two lines so I kept the first
one and the last one pretty much created

11
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:07,320
an object from this image and displayed
it in Photoshop so the first thing that

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,180
we need to do is we need to give it the
area that we want to crop so I'm going

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,299
to set it equal to area and it's
actually a 4 item couple the first two

14
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,920
parameters are the X&Y coordinates of
the top left corner so 100 100 so

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,009
actually let me probably shouldn't have
deleted that alright so we'll say that

16
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,560
we want to start at 100 over and 100
down so this is going to be our starting

17
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:46,590
point and we'll say that we'll crop to
like I don't know like 300 and 375 so in

18
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:58,350
order to do that the other parameters
are 300 and 375 now another thing I want
to point out is whenever you're making

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,320
your tupple right here make sure that
you don't go outside the main image area

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,550
so for example you can't start at 100
100 and end up at like I don't know 600

21
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,750
700 because that's off your original
image so

22
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,450
just watch out for that so this is the
area that we want to crop so now what we

23
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,430
have to basically say is create a new
image from this cropped image well the

24
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,640
first thing we need is to be able to
store this new image in its own object
so I'm going to name my new image

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,900
cropped image and now in order to crop
it take your original image and call the

26
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,320
function crop now this crop function the
only parameter that it takes is a four

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,690
digit tupple with the parameters or the
coordinates of where to crop oh that's

28
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:55,080
convenient we have one right there so
I'm going to take this and pass it in

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,350
and you can actually throw this entire
thing right in here without the need for
the area variable but then you have

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,870
these double parenthesis and it gets
kind of messy so this is actually the

31
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,370
best way to do it so what we're
basically saying is take this original

32
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,950
image of Bucky and crop out an area with
these coordinates and store that new
image in this cropped image so now if we

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:27,250
actually just show this what it's going
to do whenever you run this is check

34
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,620
this out now the reason that we have two
of these is because this is the one I

35
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,560
was demonstrating this is the one that
opened with this line right here and

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,030
whenever I ran this line look at what it
did pretty stinking cool so this is our

37
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,170
original image and this is our new
cropped image and later on I'm going to

38
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,320
be showing you guys how to you know
whatever you want to do with it whether

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,820
you want to upload it to the internet or
just save it as a JPEG or ping whatever

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,500
but that is how you do that
