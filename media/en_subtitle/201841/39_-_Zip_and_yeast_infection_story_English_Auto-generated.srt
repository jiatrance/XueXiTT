00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
all righty guys welcome to another video
and in this tutorial I want to show you

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,349
guys about the zip function Z IP now my
guess is that if you've been programming

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,099
Python for like any decent amount of
time you probably saw this a lot and

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,970
it's kind of confusing to know exactly
what it does just by looking at it the

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,350
very first time so I'll go ahead and
show you guys a real basic example now

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,000
basically what we're going to do is
we're going to have two lists of equal

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,689
lengths and we're going to zip them
together or time together so we're going

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,750
to return a final list of tuples so I'll
make a really simple demonstration this

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,770
won't be anything useful but it'll be
really easy to see what's going on so

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,690
say that we have two lists of names
Bucky and these are all first names Tom
and Taylor now we have another list of

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,199
equal lengths and this can be the last
names so Bucky my last name is Roberts

12
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,559
we'll say it's Tom Hanks and Taylor oh

13
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:11,010
my oh my pumpkin pie alright so I have
two lists right here and obviously it

14
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,909
would be really nice if we could tie
these together somehow because in our

15
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,090
program basically we're always going to
be using these together the first and

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,299
last name you always see them together
in pretty much every computer program

17
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,680
say we're making a social network or
something so what you can do instead of

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,670
iterating through the entire thing in
some kind of for loop with a counter and

19
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,490
calling um like 0 1 2 every time that
can get kind of messy so instead what
you can do is zip them together so call

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,020
the function zip and inside here is the
parameters you toss in whatever list you

21
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,600
want to zip together so this is pretty
much saying ok take the first list which

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,490
is this and the last one and tie them
together and store that in a final list

23
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,560
of tuples called names so let's go ahead
and take a look at names just so we can

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,690
visually see what exactly is going on so
again I know that I just tied together

25
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,120
listen I'm just
loop through them right now so it's kind

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,660
of pointless but again this is just a
demonstration so for a be and names

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,870
print a B so let me just run through
this and check this out

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:35,040
Bucky Roberts Tom Hanks and Taylor Swift
now like I said what this is actually

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,120
doing is making a list of tuples so it
actually looks something like this

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:56,459
Bucky Roberts um let's copy this so it's
going to look something like this

31
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:04,260
Bucky Roberts Tom Hanks and Taylor Swift
so again whenever we loop the room it's

32
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,920
going to break them apart and you can
access each individual element if you

33
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,780
need to or keep them together in a nice
zip list so again this example not very

34
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,950
good but now that we understand the
basics of what a zip is what does it

35
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,319
function is and basically how it's
constructed we're going to be seeing

36
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,400
this a lot whenever you want to actually
do something with these items like

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,450
comparing numbers say that these were
two numbers you can say okay if a is
greater than B then safe a or maybe I

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,209
don't know multiply the two numbers
together and you're looking for the

39
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,700
result something you know a little more
practical like that in a weird

40
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,340
real-world application so uh yeah there
we go and it's videos only like four

41
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,370
minutes long so I went a little faster
than actually that's it that's all the

42
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,209
Python for this video but I do have a
sort he tells since this video so short

43
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,190
and again totally unrelated Python um so
you can move on to next soro but for

44
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,569
those who want a little entertainment
this is something kind of funny that

45
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,480
Avenue I went to my mom's house last
night because there's a hockey game and

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,620
my little cousin was over there and his
mom is super strict like she only lets

47
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,099
him eat organic food and he's not
allowed to drink soda or anything like

48
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:28,360
that so me and my sister in the silicon
my little cousin were sent around the

49
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,979
dinner table and I always like to be
like kind of goofy around kids just see
how they react so my mom went to the UM

50
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,919
it was like it's it wasn't the regular
stores like this Amish store we can get
baked goods is she bought this little

51
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:47,740
loaf of bread it's like a little bit
bigger than the size of a cell phone so

52
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,409
I picked it up and I started I started
talking to like I was talking to someone

53
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:57,250
and I'm like Hello
completely serious and my sister she

54
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,360
just was like playing along with it
exactly she didn't even smile or

55
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,379
anything so now my little cousin is like
looking at me like he's thinking about

56
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,069
laughing but then he's like looking
around he's like how come no one else is

57
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:15,280
smiling is this guy like really talking
to someone on this bread phone so uh so
I'm like hello and I asked them to be

58
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,919
quiet because I can't hear very good on
my bread phone so I'm like oh it's my

59
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,389
doctor and I go oh the test results are
in

60
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:32,529
Oh what is it it's a yeast infection and
then and then my sister just busts out

61
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:36,520
laughing because she couldn't keep her I
don't know she couldn't keep a straight

62
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,130
face anymore and then his mom she comes
over if she starts flipping out because

63
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:48,039
like I said he's like she's like so
straight-edged and I did she said you

64
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,080
can't talk to him about yeast infections
and yeah yeah yeah but uh I don't know

65
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,520
like the story doesn't have a punch line
or anything so that's as good as it gets

66
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,810
but I thought it was pretty funny and
she was even more mad that me and my

67
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,800
sister were laughs and when she was like
trying to scold us or whatever but that

68
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,900
is my yeast infection story so oh well
thank you guys for watching now you know
about syphilis and I will see you next

69
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,330
time
