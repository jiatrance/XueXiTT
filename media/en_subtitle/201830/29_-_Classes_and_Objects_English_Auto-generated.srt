00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,560
alright guys welcome back to another
tutorial and in this video finally going

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,000
to start talking to you about classes
and objects and some cool things that

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,889
you can do with them so first of all
what the heck is a class well the most

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,630
simple definition is basically a class
is an easy way where you can group

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,210
similar variables and functions together
so say you're making a computer game

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,400
usually all of the functions dealing
with enemies and all the variables
through you would want in an enemy class

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,850
maybe you have a different one for
moving your character around well all of

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,989
those functions for moving your main
character would be in a character class
so on and so forth so again the most

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,780
simple definition is it's a really cool
way we can group similar variables and

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,719
functions together might be in record
okay just check in so with that being

11
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,800
said let's go ahead and look at an
example right now so in order to make a
class type the keyword class and then at

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,080
his face now class pretty much says hey
Python I'm about to make a class now

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,340
after this what you want to do is you
want to name your class something and

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,439
it's common practice to name it with a
capital letter and this is just so
programmers can differentiate between a

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,790
class and like a normal variable or a
function or anything like that so this

16
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,170
is how we make a class called enemy now
add a colon now whatever is indented

17
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,540
after this is going to be part of your
enemy class so every variable inside

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,909
here and every function is going to
belong to this enemy class so let's go

19
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,009
ahead and make a simple variable first
so we'll say that each enemy has a life

20
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,250
of 3 so now this life variable is
actually part of this enemy class just

21
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,409
remember that so now what we can do is
we can make a couple functions for this

22
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:04,290
class so what's one thing that we can do
we'll say we'll make a function called

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,690
attack and this is just some what
happens whenever we attack an enemy now

24
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,800
check this out whenever I'm just writing
these parentheses right here

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,670
what PyCharm did is automatically filled
in this keyword of self now this is
going to be a little confusing until I

26
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,480
finish this program and explain what
objects are but pretty much think of

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,440
whenever you see self it means use
something from this own class so if you

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,790
say you're going to see later like self
attack it means use the attack function

29
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,140
in this class self life means use the
life variable in this class again kind

30
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,950
of confusing at first but you guys are
going to see later on what it does

31
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,250
alright so let's make this function
actually do something whenever we attack

32
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,030
the anime we'll just do something like
print attack or actually let's print

33
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,040
ouch
we'll say that at the end we says ouch

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,240
and also what we want to do is we want
to subtract one from the enemy's life

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,750
now we can't just do this check it out
if we just try to subtract one from life

36
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,550
we get a little error what we actually
need to do is what I was talking about

37
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:24,090
put self life so that's how you access
the variables inside your class so

38
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,430
pretty much self is saying okay inside
this class take away one from the life

39
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,470
variable simple enough maybe it was easy
I don't understand who knew all right so

40
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,370
let's make one more function so this
class isn't that boring I'll make

41
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,800
another function to check the enemy's
life and of course it automatically

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,050
fills in that self variable and we'll
say I don't know maybe a little if

43
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:58,320
statement so if self not slough so if
self life is less than or equal to zero
and this is actually another thing I

44
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,980
want to point out whenever you're making
computer games don't just check if the
enemy's life is equal to zero to see if

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,820
they're dead because like if they had
three life and you had like a super

46
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,109
powerful weapon to like slash them in
and took away five life well then their

47
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,708
life would be negative two so always
make sure to check if it's less than or

48
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:26,460
equal to zero just a little I don't know
tip for game development so if they're

49
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,520
less than or equal to
we'll just print something like I am

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,639
dead Bob the enemy obviously couldn't
say anything if it was dead but this is

51
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,439
our game we could do what do you want
alright so if they're dead they're dead

52
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,240
else we'll just print out like how much
life they had lab so print something

53
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,469
like of course we need to convert it to
a string so print out the amount of life

54
00:04:52,469 --> 00:05:01,319
that they have left and we'll just do
something like this life left like -

55
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:07,289
life left one life left
tomato tomahto alright so right now we
have a very simple class of enemy so the

56
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,650
enemy has three life and we can attack
him whenever we call this function it
takes one life away and also anytime we

57
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,110
can have it check to see how much life
the enemy has if it's dead it prints out

58
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,939
I'm dead or if it's not that it tells
you how much life you guys love simple

59
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:38,400
enough now if we just try to do
something like this attack okay well
that's not working now the reason that

60
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:47,819
this doesn't work is because in order to
use anything inside your class you need

61
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,099
to access it a special way and that is
by creating something called an object

62
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:58,139
now an object just think of it like this
it's pretty much a way that you can

63
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,039
access the stuff inside your class and I
know I just say that twice but it's

64
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,310
actually really important to understand
and they're really easy to make as well

65
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,469
so the first thing you do is you pretty
much act like you're making a normal

66
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:16,740
variable so I'm going to make a object
called enemy one so what you said it

67
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,219
equal to is the class that you want to
use stuff from so I want to use the

68
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:29,310
stuff inside the enemy class so anytime
I want to use that I need this object

69
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:37,229
code enemy 1 and it's object from this
class right here so now we can just do

70
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,120
something called enemy one

71
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,550
attack and what this pretty much means
is this it says okay enemy one is an

72
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:56,819
object from what class while enemy so go
to the class enemy and once you're in

73
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:04,080
there use attack so now if we try to run
this it would say ouch because it just
took one away from the enemy and

74
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:13,889
actually if we check life to make sure
that worked whenever we run this said

75
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,830
okay it starts with three of course so
we're going to attack this enemy once

76
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:25,740
say ouch
then it says two life left now I want to

77
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,690
show you guys one other really cool
thing and this is probably the main

78
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:37,889
reason that people use classes all the
time see each object is actually a copy

79
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,259
of its class so each object is actually
independent of one another

80
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,569
so check this out don't understand what
I mean you will in just a second say

81
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:55,080
that we have enemy one instead we have
another enemy called enemy to actually
let me code this entire thing and then

82
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:03,199
I'll talk you guys through do this

83
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,440
alright so what's going to happen is
we're going to make two objects or two

84
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,599
copies from this class one of them is
going to be stored in the object enemy

85
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,819
one and another one is going to be
stored in the object enemy two now each

86
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,800
of these are pretty much thinking though
think of them like their own enemies so

87
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,699
each of those has three life each so
whenever you attack enemy one it doesn't

88
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:37,348
affect enemy two so let me run this and
I'll show you guys what I'm talking

89
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:44,519
about so we created two objects we
attacked and me one twice and then check

90
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,199
this life and it had one life left
however enemy two is still had three

91
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:53,060
life left so this is how people make
computer games

92
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,610
with one class which is pretty much a
template of how do you want to code the

93
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,570
enemy how do you want it to act and
behave and you can create as many of

94
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,810
them as you want just by making an
object for each one so how awesome is
that

95
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,930
so that is the basics of a class pretty
much not only a group of similar

96
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,270
functions and objects but pretty much a
template of how you want an object to

97
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,460
behave and act and of course you can
make as many copies of it as you want

98
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,700
and each of the objects are independent
of one another so if you guys don't

99
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,130
completely understand this or it seems
kind of like unfamiliar whenever we

100
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,089
start making other programs is going to
become second nature and also really

101
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:46,580
easy to understand but that is the
basics of classes and objects in Python

102
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,779
and also if you have any questions then
ask me on my forum but for now thank you

103
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:55,600
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you next tutorial
