00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,200
okay so everyone on Bucky's room was
telling me that my font was too small so

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,809
this is my new font hopefully it isn't
too big it's kind of big when I'm just
you know kind of like looking at on the

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,839
screen but hopefully um I think a lot of
you guys had smaller resolution monitors

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,830
so even when you stretch it out to 1080
the video was still kind of small so
hopefully um that's a good size if it's

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,740
not then just leave a comment and I'll
read them and adjust it appropriately
but anyways in this video I'm going to

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,210
show you how to read and write files so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to be

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,590
creating a file first and then I'll show
you guys how to read from it so to

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,329
create a file the first thing we need is
a file object again just name it any

9
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,559
variable I'm going to name it fw4 file
right in other words file create so what

10
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,199
you do is you set this equal to this
function open and what this is going to

11
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,420
do is it's going to open a file or
pretty much prepare a file to be created

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,129
or written so the first parameter it
takes is the name of the file what do

13
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,659
you want to name this file that you're
creating well I'll just name it sample

14
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,509
text will create a very simple text file
now the next parameter after this it's

15
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,540
going to take a couple different
characters if you watch my seed

16
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,159
tutorials then you guys are already
familiar with all these but for this

17
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,439
tutorial I'm going to show you guys W in
are the first one is w which means open
a file and write to it so since this

18
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,220
file isn't created yet it's going to
open it and create it and what right

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,490
means is it prepares us to write text to
it so of course it's a text file let's

20
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,960
add some text to it now any time you
actually work with a file the first

21
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,329
thing you do is use your file object
mine's named FW and then you write what

22
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,770
do you want to do with that file well
there are a couple different functions

23
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,619
as you can see but what we're going to
do is just write to it basically um it's

24
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,450
like the equivalent of typing on it
simple enough and of course what do you

25
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,319
want to write so writing some stuff in
text file and also what you can do just
like whenever you print out string you

26
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,590
can use a special character backslash N
and that will move to a new line on your

27
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,090
file pretty sweet so now since we're on
a new line we'll go ahead and write

28
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,180
something else FW which is our file
sample.txt and write something else on

29
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:42,480
this line and we'll just write like I
like can you type Bucky bacon and
actually we could just put this all on

30
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:49,380
one line but I just wanted to
demonstrate that I don't know this is

31
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:55,140
just a cool way to do it all right
so whenever we're done working with a

32
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:02,430
file what we need to do is we need to
close our file object so FW close now

33
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,540
this doesn't take any parameters what it
does is it basically just frees up on
the extra memory so you aren't wasting

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,110
it so this object just isn't sitting
around in your computer so now as you

35
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,700
can see oh yeah by the way I deleted
that image from the last store oh just
because I don't know it was making some

36
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,350
clutter so right now whenever we create
this file by running this program you're

37
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,060
going to see a new file appear right
here so keep your eye on this whenever I

38
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,359
run this see that how it just popped up
now let's double click it to check it

39
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:43,440
out so what it did is it wrote this line
first and then this line and then a bump

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,549
down to a new line pretty sweet so that
is how you create files and Python so

41
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,030
now that we know how to write files or
create them let me show you how to read

42
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:02,069
them so in order to read a file you of
course need another file object and I'm

43
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,910
just going to name this one fr4 file
read you can actually name anything you

44
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,310
want but FR is just easy for me to
remember now again this is just object

45
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,810
that pretty much represents a file so we
need to open some file and this is going

46
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,549
to look familiar
we'll open sample dot txt so this pretty

47
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,580
much says okay
we're working with this file

48
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,270
then we need to tell Python what we want
to do with it well we want to read it

49
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,500
we're not creating anything we just want
to read data from it so the character

50
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:40,680
for that is our so now whenever we read
all of this data we need somewhere to

51
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,879
store it because we can't just work with
it directly in Python so we need a

52
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,259
variable to store that entire string so
I'm going to store in a variable called

53
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,330
text and just think of this like a
normal string variable so what you do is
make a variable and set it equal to Fr

54
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:04,229
dot read and what this is going to do is
essentially go to your file read all of

55
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:09,509
the crap in it and store it in this
variable called text so now we can just

56
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,250
do anything the text that we would with
string variables such as print text or

57
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,789
anything else
so whenever we do this it's going to

58
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,389
print out the contents of this file on
the screen and of course when we're done

59
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:29,909
remember to close it close and that just
closes the file object so now if we read

60
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:36,800
this check it out in this first little
chunk of code we actually created it and

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,979
then this next one we read the
information that was in it the text all

62
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,879
this stuff and then we just took it
stored it in a variable and printed it

63
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,199
out on the screen and of course just to
be nice to our computer we closed it

64
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,569
gave its back memory so simple enough
that is how you read and write files and

65
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:02,430
in the next video what I'm going to show
you guys how to do is actually read a

66
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,050
text file from somewhere on the Internet
and this is actually cool whenever

67
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,500
you're like making a bot or web crawler
and you want to crawl a bunch of

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,370
webpages get the links in storm in a
text file I'll show you guys have to do

69
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,539
that it's like a really simple version
of we're going to be making like a

70
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,589
really simple version of Google
eventually and I mean really simple not

71
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,979
anywhere that complex but anyways I'll
stop rambling now I'll see you guys

72
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,039
later
