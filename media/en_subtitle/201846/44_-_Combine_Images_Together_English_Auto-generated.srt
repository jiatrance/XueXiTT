00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,990
all righty house is welcome back should
open all of my videos with that intro

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,530
I really hate actually when I'm watching
a YouTube video and they have the same
intro like I don't know they made a

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,640
weird umm animation of their channel
name at the beginning of every video but

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,660
maybe if you had something personal like
me

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,949
manually singing each intro like today
we're going to learn about pasting

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,760
images then I well then I probably
losing my subscribers so probably

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,420
shouldn't do that but in this video what
I'm going to be showing you guys is how

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,910
to take two images and combine with
together basically the equivalent of
copying one image such as this and

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,680
pasting it on top of another image so
that's what we're going to do so I'm

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,710
going to take this little girl's head
and paste it right in the middle of this

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,750
there is no point to it whatsoever but
it's awesome just for demonstrating so

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,190
the first thing we need is to make two
different objects two different pillow

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,060
objects one of this image in one of this
image so I'm going to name the first one

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,100
sister why not
of course that's image open and the
parameter is the file name so sister dot

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,430
it's jpg and for the second one that's
actually a ping this one right here and

16
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm Way too lazy to type all that so it
was actually probably could've type to

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,049
the faster girl dot ping so now we have
two pillow objects one this and one is

18
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:44,549
that bada-bing bada-boom pretty easy so
far so the first thing we need is we

19
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,040
actually say okay we're going to be
pasting something on top of this image

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,509
right here so we need to give it the
area that we want to paste now we also

21
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,469
know that this is the image that we're
pretty much going to copy and paste in

22
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,090
but what we have to do right now is a
little math so whenever I click on this

23
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,979
implied charm we can see that the size
of this is 200 by 200 now I am stressing

24
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,670
this because whenever we paste it on
we need to give it the exact coordinates
and that area needs to be 200 by 200 if

25
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,750
the coordinates you give it are off it
all then you're going to come across the

26
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,830
area
I'm at an error three reason I said area

27
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,870
is because that's what I'm going to type
so since I want to paste in the middle

28
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,220
and this original image is 400 by 400
the coordinates the post a 200 by 200

29
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:50,920
image is 3 right there
so again 100 by 100 is a top left

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,260
somewhere around here and 300 by 300 is
right down here somewhere

31
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,710
and of course since this is 200 by 200
then this area is going to fit perfectly

32
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:08,470
so now that we determine the area what
we need to do now is we need to take

33
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,480
that original image which is the sister
object and we need to call a function

34
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,590
called paste now paste is going to take
two parameters the first thing that's

35
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,060
going to say is okay what are you
pasting on top of this sister richer

36
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,480
well we're actually going to be pasting
this object which is this image so we're

37
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,310
going to be pasting that on top of it
and the only other thing is it asks okay

38
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,740
now give me the coordinates of where you
want to paste it okay sir well we

39
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,920
actually just made them right there and
well there you go
all right so now what we did is we

40
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:52,030
basically took this sister image and we
pasted something on top of it so now if

41
00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:01,510
we just call sister show check this out
run main look at that now of course if

42
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,950
you look in this file display whatever
it's called the file name you can see

43
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,330
that this is indeed one image these
aren't two separate files and if you're

44
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,380
familiar with Photoshop these are the
layers this is actually one layer so we
took that image and we pasted it in

45
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:22,240
exactly so I'll show you guys what I'm
talking about if we said that our paste

46
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,689
area was like 334 for the second one
whenever we try to run

47
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,960
then we're going to get a bunch of
problems right here because it says
pretty much the area that you're pasting

48
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:40,180
into is not equal to the size of the
object so that's why I kept stressing

49
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,919
the math you have to calculate it before
I also show you guys later on um how you

50
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,460
like right now we'd probably have to
take a calculator if we had any weird

51
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,530
size images but I'll show you guys how
to get the sizes dynamically and figure

52
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,500
it out like that but you guys probably
could already figure it out from the

53
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,879
toriel so far so I'm just going to stop
rambling that is how you take to him

54
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,060
just paste them together thank you guys
for watching and we can subscribe and

55
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,020
I'll see you guys next time
