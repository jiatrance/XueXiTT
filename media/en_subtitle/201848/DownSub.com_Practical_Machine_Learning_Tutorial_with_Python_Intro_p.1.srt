00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,870
Well, girls and guys and welcome to an

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,060
in-depth machine learning tutorial series.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,440
The objective of this tutorial series is
to give you a holistic understanding of

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,740
machine learning and how it works and
we're going to be doing this by covering

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,110
a variety of algorithms so first we're
gonna be covering regression then we're

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,100
going to be moving into classification
with k-nearest neighbors and support

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,480
vector machines and then we're going to
get into clustering with flat clustering

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,510
a hierarchical clustering and then
finally we'll be getting into deep

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,030
learning with neural networks.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,540
So, each step of the way with each of the major algorithms

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,660
we're going to cover a theory,
application and then we're going to dive

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,159
in deep to the inner workings of each of
them

13
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,389
so with theory this is the high-level
intuitions it's actually pretty quick to

14
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:48,899
digest the theory of all the algorithms.
Most of the algorithms are actually

15
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,280
fairly basic since they need to be able
to scale to very large amounts of data.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,059
Then we move on to application this is
also fairly quick

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,959
we're going to use a module like
scikit-learn and apply these algorithms

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,780
to real-world data to see exactly how
they work what kind of input they expect

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,300
from us and what kind of output we
should expect back from them.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,000
Then finally we dive into the inner workings
in the way that we're going to do this

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,770
is by recreating the algorithms
themselves from scratch in code

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,579
including all the math and all that so
when you do this you'll be able to have

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,360
a truly complete understanding of how
these algorithms work which is going to

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,660
help you down the line

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,640
So, in order to
fall along with a series i strongly

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,780
suggest you at least have the basics of
Python 3 down understood if you don't

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,509
I do have a Python 3 basics tutorial
series here

28
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,869
check that out you really just need to
get at least to the point where we

29
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,729
install modules with pip.

30
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,020
After that you can continue on but you
really need those that initial I think

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,789
it's like maybe 10 or 15 videos of core
understanding of Python. We'll also be

32
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,509
covering a healthy amount of math here
but we'll be talking about the matting

33
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,350
and explaining that as we go for sure so
you're not really expected to know much

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,760
about math

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,960
becoming mostly algebra and geometry
that comes up.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,330
So, machine learning was really came
about in the fifties so like more than a

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,210
half century ago now and it was defined
in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the field of

38
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,010
study where we give machines the ability
to learn without being explicitly

39
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,050
programmed to do so.

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,160
So, the way I kind of like to think of it
is it's in viewing knowledge to a

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,570
machine without hard coding that
knowledge so interestingly enough when I

42
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,620
talk to people both programmers and
non-programmers and and and find out

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,510
what they know about machine learning

44
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,710
most people think machine learning is
hard-coded so when you ask them what's

45
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,730
wrong with machine learning or how is it
different from actual learning that's

46
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,990
where you find that most people think
it's hard coded so kind of interesting

47
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,530
issue there that most people are
completely unaware that this field

48
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,840
exists and it's actually not being hard
coded so that was one machine learning

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,730
was actually kind of defined in 1963
Vladimir Vapnik came up with the support

50
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,150
vector machine but this really went
pretty much overlooked until the

51
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,020
90s so Vladimir Vapnik was in the
Soviet Union and then in the 90s he

52
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,830
was actually scooped out of the Soviet
Union by bell labs and that's when he

53
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,400
showed that that the support vector
machine was better than the neural

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,500
network at the time doing handwritten
character recognition so it's

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,800
handwritten digits of our call right but
anyway it was better than the support

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,090
vector a better than the neural network
at that task the support vector machines

57
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,190
really took the lead for quite some time
really up until very recently when

58
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,989
Google basically has kind of come back
to really put some weight behind the

59
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,209
neural network specifically with deep
learning.

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
But if you think you're kind of late to the to the party

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,020
so to speak
with machine learning I assure you

62
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,190
you're not because I mean think about
computers in the 95s  i mean

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,310
we're talking

64
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,510
we just started putting transistors on
printed circuits instructions to your

65
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:04,260
computer was a maximum of a handful of
bits at a time so pretty bad i mean even

66
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,480
think about your computers in the 90s

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,730
this was very hard at

68
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,769
even if you were like a PhD student is
very difficult to even get access to a

69
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,529
machine that could run significantly a
support vector machine at scale [let's say].

70
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,010
Whereas nowadays we live in a time where
you can engage in deep learning with

71
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,169
neural networks on like gigabytes or
even terabytes of data and what you can

72
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,010
do is you can spin up a you know
hundred-thousand-dollar GPU cluster on

73
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,449
amazon web services and basically just
rent it for a few dollars an hour and

74
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:37,440
then be done with it

75
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,750
that's incredible like we living an
incredible time this is the best time to

76
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,680
be alive is I think right now is the
first time we've really been able to

77
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,310
really stretch and flex the muscles of
machine learning up to this point it's

78
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,930
really been learning without the machine
part so we also so much to the point

79
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,550
where like with scikit-learn you can you
can use scikit-learn with almost no

80
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,270
understanding at all you just apply it
and you can usually get about

81
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,860
90~95% accuracy without
messing with the default parameter

82
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,410
yeah you can just get it with the
default parameters so that's also pretty

83
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,550
crazy right

84
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,120
you want to push the limits and get more
accuracy out of it then you need to

85
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,080
learn how they work and how you can
tweak those parameters so you're working

86
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,310
on self-driving car getting 90 to
95% accuracy and

87
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,729
identifying the difference between like
a blob of tar and a child in a blanket

88
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,680
that's not good enough you need much any
more accuracy than that

89
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,700
so anyway that's what this series is for
is for the people are really looking to

90
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,090
push the limits on what's available so
if you really just want to learn the

91
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,530
basics actually already have some simple
machine learning tutorials out there for

92
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,750
just applying machine learning to a
dataset you can do this actually very

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,870
very fast.

94
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,740
So anyways the first topic that we're
gonna be covering is regression and

95
00:05:52,740 --> 00:00:00,000
let's go ahead and get into it.
