1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
all righty guys welcome back to another
video and these next I want to say like

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,300
five to ten videos they're going to be
the coolest place on tutorials so far

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,269
because I'm going to show you guys how
to use this awesome

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,039
library it's actually really easy to use
but you can do awesome things to images

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,390
like rotate them stretch them resize
them you can actually make some really

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,099
awesome photo filters like you would in
Photoshop or Instagram so I'm gonna be

7
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,119
showing you guys all of that so uh well
let's go ahead and get started

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,969
oh now freakin whooping-cough already
actually winter just started we just got

9
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,500
the first snowfall and for some reason
whenever the snow starts falling the

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,550
inside of my house gets really dry like
my skin starts drying out but that's

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,020
disgusting so let's get back on track
here now obviously I'm going to be

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,100
teaching you guys how to edit images do
some cool things with them so we

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,520
probably need some images now I already
took a couple from my computer we should

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,979
show them to you guys here's me is baby
I'm also going to be using this one this

15
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,290
is my old profile picture for Bucky's
room

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,810
this girl ping I just made this in
Photoshop real quick um I don't know why

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,080
I chose this I thought it was kind of
funny she looks like I don't even know

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,610
she looks like but I needed something
with some colors and the last photo I'm

19
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,360
going to be using is a picture of my
sister and I so of course just go ahead

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,979
and grab any picture or image from your
computer and drag in the same directory

21
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,630
is your Python file and you're going to
be good but if for some reason you want

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,680
to use my pictures then I'll post them
on the forum but you know you probably

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,189
don't want to look at me throughout the
whole series so again go get any
pictures drop them in and you'll be good

24
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,909
to go so now that we have some pictures
to work with the only other thing that

25
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,610
we need to do kind of to prepare is
download that library now if you go to

26
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,229
file settings of course you can see all
your libraries the package is called

27
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,750
pillow so whenever you of course
download it click this type in pillow

28
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,950
and you'll be good to go so again that's
pillow but check this out

29
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,000
whenever we actually import the library
what we're going to do is we're going to

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,860
type from PIL import the class image all
right so we're going to be using this

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,569
image class first but wait a minute
buggy you just will need to download the
pillow library but right here I'm

32
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,890
importing from pill so what the heck is
up with that why is it called pill well

33
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,980
if this is probably pretty boring but I
just want to explain to you guys what's

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,170
going on so you aren't confused right
now we're using Python 3.4 this isn't

35
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,720
actually code I'll just type it out real
quick so we're using Python 3.4 and the

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,819
library to edit images is called pillow
now in the old version of Python that

37
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,620
isn't compatible with what I'm teaching
you guys the old version was called pill

38
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,549
so what they did for the new version is
they pretty much copied it made it

39
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,390
compatible with three point four and
named the pillow so why didn't they just
put pillow right there well for all the

40
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,890
pretty much programmers who wanted who
are already familiar with the syntax of

41
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,510
this library they wanted to you know
make it kind of convention familiar for

42
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,540
them so that's why they just imported it
from pill and you know so I don't know

43
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,280
it's a pretty stupid story but um that's
why it's called pill instead of pillow

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,600
to make it kind of compatible and
comfortable for all the people who are

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,420
familiar with using it so cool story bro
I know but uh whatever so now that we

46
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,440
got everything taken care of let's go
ahead and get started making a basic

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,170
image so the first thing we need to do
is create some kind of object from this

48
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,359
image class a pillow object so I'm just
going to name my object IMG it's the

49
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:03,940
most boring thing I possibly could have
thunk of this sinc funk think think it

50
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,180
of yep that's it think it up alright so
in order to create an object image dot

51
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:17,019
open and in this open function what you
do is you just type the name of what do

52
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,050
I want to use all right so I'll take
this image from my computer Bucky jpg

53
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,600
and what we're saying is pretty much
openness

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,340
and convert it to a pillow object so now
this IMG variable is actually a pillow
object so now we can do a bunch of cool

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,340
things with it before I start showing
you guys the really advanced functions
of how to manipulate it I'll just show

56
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,680
you guys a couple
boring stuff first but it's actually

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,580
slept we're going to be using a lot so
the first thing is just to print out

58
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,800
some properties of this object or the
image so we can print out the image size

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,610
and the dot symbol and then size
property or attribute so actually you

60
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:06,130
run this right now and you see your
returns a tuple of 400 by 400 that of

61
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:12,760
course means that this image is 400 by
wide by 400 wide by 400 tall and we can

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,900
also print out something like I don't
know it's another thing format is

63
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,120
another property and what this does is
it says okay so right now we can see

64
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,840
that it's a JPEG and later on I'm going
to be showing you guys how to convert
for example if we you wanted to convert

65
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,860
this JPEG to a ping or a gif I'm going
to be showing you guys how to do that as

66
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,860
well but right now this is how you print
out simple properties of it and one cool

67
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,310
thing that I also want to show you guys
is this anytime you want to actually

68
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,930
display this image then what you can do
is you can type the name of the object

69
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,930
and show now I want to explain one thing
down here

70
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,340
you can't display images this is just a
console it's pretty much like a fancy
command line built just for PyCharm it

71
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:05,680
isn't made to display images itself so
whenever you want to display an image on

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,480
your computer what happens whenever you
call this function is it goes to the

73
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,030
default program that you whenever you
you know you're just um put on show you
guys

74
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,010
whenever you're just looking at files
like this and you double click

75
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,620
whenever you double click an image file
however it opens is the default image

76
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,690
processing program for your computer now
since I have Photoshop installed on my

77
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,750
computer whenever I run this the image
is going to open in Photoshop but if you

78
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,199
don't have Photoshop then I might just
open window explore or anything like

79
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,509
that but that's what's going on you also
probably notice that whenever this open

80
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:53,019
in Photoshop look at the name in Python
it was named Bucky jpg but in Photoshop

81
00:06:53,019 --> 00:07:01,809
it is named tum 5 a 6 a 3 b JV BMP and
what this is is basically in order to

82
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:05,679
open in Photoshop it needs to open a
file
so what pillow does whenever you call

83
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:16,659
this show function it pretty much
creates a temporary image file and it

84
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:20,589
saves it real quick and then it opens it
with whatever program that you told it

85
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:26,349
to open so that is the basics and pretty
much all the boring stuff of you know

86
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:31,449
the boring history of pillow some boring
attributes and you know some boring

87
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:37,359
rules about open how to open it in
temporary file names so now that we got
all that crap out of the way we can

88
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,879
finally begin learning the cool stuff
and I'm going to talk to you guys about

89
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,809
that stuff in the next video because I'm
pretty hungry and I'm probably going to

90
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:51,129
go eat like seven hot pockets right now
so moving on I don't thank you guys for

91
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:55,889
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys next tutorial
